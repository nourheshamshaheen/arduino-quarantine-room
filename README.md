# arduino-quarantine-room
A quarantine room with temperature and distance sensors. 

This is a system based on non-contact that maintains the ventilation of the place and keeps the temperature
almost constant in the room by controlling the windows in a way that it can switch at higher or lower temperature, in addition to a
social distance detector which turns on a buzzer alarm when you are less than (2meters) 6 feet away to maintain social distancing.
This newly designed quarantine room will be preventive to the transmission of the virus.
